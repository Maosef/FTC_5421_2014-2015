## Special Thanks
To Frank for all of the mentoring help, and Jon for being the premier codemaster of RM Robotics. You both rock :)

Code was inspired partly by:
  - Xander (of course), especially his [RVW Maze Crawler](http://botbench.com/blog/2013/05/27/robot-virtual-worlds-maze-crawler/)
  - [Elliot Berman] (http://blog.elliotjb.com/2013/10/holonomic-x-drive-tutorial-programming_31.html)'s holonomic drive tutorial
  - James Pearman's awe-inducing [SmartMotorLib](https://github.com/jpearman/smartMotorLib)
