## Checklist for debugging
1) Check if robot is powered on.
2) Check to see if you are compiling for PC emulator or Robot.
3) Check battery levels.
4) Check for RobotC joystick misinterpretation.
5) Check to see if the function you are debugging is being called.
6) Check motor and servo configurations.

## Special Thanks
To Frank for all of the mentoring help, and Jon for being the premier codemaster of RM Robotics. You both rock :)

Code was inspired partly by:
  - Xander (of course), especially his [RVW Maze Crawler](http://botbench.com/blog/2013/05/27/robot-virtual-worlds-maze-crawler/)
  - [Elliot Berman] (http://blog.elliotjb.com/2013/10/holonomic-x-drive-tutorial-programming_31.html)'s holonomic drive tutorial
  - James Pearman's awe-inducing [SmartMotorLib](https://github.com/jpearman/smartMotorLib)
  - ['Oly Cow's FTC Code](https://github.com/OlyCow/FTC_2013-2014)
